abstract: This three-day training school organised by the CLS Infra project
  focused on dynamic collections of literary texts manipulated programmatically.
  Learners will learn to find, evaluate, and select corpora using tools like
  CLSCor and DraCor, and gain skills in Python, Jupyter Notebooks, API querying,
  Linked Open Data, and Digital Literary Network Analysis. The training
  addresses reproducibility using Docker, promoting transparent, replicable
  research in Computational Literary Studies.

about: "ExploreCor: Using Programmable Corpora in Computational Literary
  Studies” is a three-day academic training school, organised by the CLS Infra
  project, taking place in Vienna in from June 10-12, 2024. This intensive
  program covers some of the most important steps in the research cycle of
  Computational Literary Studies, focusing on “Programmable Corpora” – dynamic
  collections of literary texts manipulated programmatically. Participants will
  delve into finding, evaluating, and selecting corpora using tools like the
  CLSCor metadata catalogue and DraCor. The curriculum spans from learning how
  to use Python and Jupyter Notebooks for analysis, querying and retrieving data
  via APIs to working with Linked Open Data and how to conduct Digital Literary
  Network Analysis. Addressing the Reproducibility Crisis, the training school
  introduces Docker for research encapsulation. Attendees gain practical skills
  to conduct transparent and replicable research, contributing to the
  advancement of Computational Literary Studies."
